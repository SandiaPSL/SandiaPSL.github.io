# Suncal Web Interface

The Suncal Web interface provides these tools:

- [Uncertainty Propagation](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SandiaPSL/suncal-web/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FUncertainty%20Propagation.ipynb): GUM and Monte Carlo Risk Propagation
- [Risk Basic](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SandiaPSL/suncal-web/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FRisk%20Basic.ipynb): Basic measurement decision risk given in-tolerance probability, test uncertainty ratio, and guardbanding.
- [Risk Advanced](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SandiaPSL/suncal-web/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FRisk%20Advanced.ipynb): Advanced measurement decision risk given any probability distribution.
- [Risk Curves](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SandiaPSL/suncal-web/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FRisk%20Curves.ipynb): Plot measurement decision risk over a range of values of TUR, ITP, and guardband
- [Student T Table](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SandiaPSL/suncal-web/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FStudent%20T%20Table.ipynb): Calculate coverage factors, level of confidence, and degrees of freedom using Student T distribution
- [Units Converter](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SandiaPSL/suncal-web/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FUnits%20Converter.ipynb): Experiment with units supported by Suncal

## About

Suncal web interface runs the same code as the full [desktop](https://sandiapsl.github.io) version, but a lite user interface built to run in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks, presented by [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html). Calculations are (currently) run online in a [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) server environment.

### Limitations

Some features are only available in the desktop version, including:

- Loading and saving calculation setup
- Saving output reports
- Reverse and swept uncertainty propagation
- Analysis of Variance calculations
- Calibration interval analysis
