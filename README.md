# Uncertainty Calculator

## Primary Standards Lab, Sandia National Laboratories

The PSL Uncertainty Calculator is developed by the Primary Standards Lab at Sandia National Laboratories to calculate the combined uncertainty of a system of multiple input parameters.

In general, a measurement value is calculated from a function of several input measurements: Y = f(x1, x2, x3...).
Each input X value has a measured value and associated uncertainty.
This calculator will determine the total uncertainty in the output quantity Y.
Two approaches are used, the Kline-McClintock uncertainty approximation as described in the Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurements (GUM), and a Monte-Carlo method.

Other features include risk analysis (probability of false accept and reject), analysis of variance, and finding uncertainty in curve fitting.
